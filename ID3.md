My study notes, contains Math behind all the mainstream tree-based machine learning models, covering basic decision tree models (ID3, C4.5, CART), boosted models (GBM, AdaBoost, Xgboost, LightGBM), bagging models (Random Forest).



Decision Tree
------------
**1. ID3 Model**
> One Sentence Summary:   
Using the information gain matrix to find the features in each split.

- **a. What is information gain**    

  We define entropy H(X) as a matrix to reflect the uncertainty of a random variable. 
  Suppose that a random variable X follows the below dirtribution:

  Then the entropy of X is as below:

So the information gain g(D, A) of dataset D given feature A is as below:

- **b. How to compute information gain**  

  Suppose that the dataset D has k category, each category is C1, c2, ... , ck.
Suppose that feature A can split the dataset into n subset D1, D2, D3,..., Dn.  
Suppose that Dik denotes the subset of the sample of category k in subset Di.  
    1. **compute H(D) of dataset D**   
    |A| means the number of sample in A

    2. **compute H(D|A) of dataset D given condition A**  
    suppose givne condition A, we split the area into D1, D2, ..., Dn, totally n parts. Then the H(D|A) is as below:  
    ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cbg_black%20H%28D%7CA%29%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CD_i%7C%7D%7B%7CD%7C%7DH%28D_%7Bi%7D%29%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CD_i%7C%7D%7B%7CD%7C%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7BK%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CD_%7Bik%7D%7C%7D%7B%7CD_i%7C%7D%5Clog%28%5Cfrac%7B%7CD_%7Bik%7D%7C%7D%7B%7CD_i%7C%7D%29)    

- **c. The actual ID3 model & algorithm**  
During each split, we find the feature that gives the dataset the maximum increase in information gain (g(D, A)).  

  Model Input: dataset D, feature set A, stopping threshold e.  
Model Output: ID3 decision tree.  
 
  **Recurrent Algorithm**:  
  (1) If all the sample in D already only belongs one class Ck, stop splitting at this node, set this final node to be class Ck.  
  
  (2.1) If A is empty, then we stop splitting at this node, set this final node to be the class that has the most samples.    
  (2.2) If A is not empty, then we loop through all the features in A, compute the information gain for each of them using the above equation.
  Suppose among them the maximum information gain is ga, obtained by splitting on the featurea a.   
  (2.2.1) If ga > threshold e, then we split on feature a, and break dataset into separate subset Di based on different value of category a. For each subset dataset in {D1, D2, ... Di}, treat Di as the new dataset D, treat A-{a} as the new feature set A, recurrently continue this splitting process.  
  (2.2.2) If ga <= threshold e, then we split stop splitting at this node, set this final node to be the class that has the most samples.
